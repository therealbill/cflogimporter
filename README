This set of scripts can be used to pull Amazon CloudFront logs down to local files.


The first script retrieves them from the S3 bucket you configure it to pull from. 
Configured CloudFront logging is covered by Amazon here: http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/AccessLogs.html

When it retrieves the logs it converts them from their initial format to a tab delineated set of fields. It further repalces the first two fields with a human readable timestamp and a unix timestamp respectively. It then adds each entry to a Redis instance. From there the second script takes over.

The second script will extract those logs in temporal order and write them out to a log file in a /var/log/YYY-MM-DD/ directory.


These two scripts are intended ot be run periodically such as through cron.


Iniitally written for a single bucket. I need to add more error handling and woudl like to convert it to a configfile based system and support multiple buckets or even accounts. It was done airly quickly and I'd like to clean it up and make it easier to follow.


As soon as I get time. ;)
